# GTASAMonitor

Two pages of code I wrote to enable me to access data from the GTA: San Andreas.
GTASA.cpp makes use of windows.h to access memory of GTA:SA and GTA.cpp is the DLL class for Java Native Interface. JNI allows this project to be run on Java project. I used this to make a map of vehicles around the player (using Swing library).
